# PDF Content Extractor - User Guide

## 1. Overview
The PDF Content Extractor is a secure, locally-hosted desktop application designed for high-fidelity extraction of text and images from PDF documents. It parses documents into pure Markdown, inline mixed Markdown, and discrete high-resolution image assets without relying on external cloud processing.

## 2. System Requirements
- Operating System: Windows 10 or Windows 11
- Environment: The provided `start.bat` script automatically creates an isolated Python virtual environment and installs all required dependencies.

## 3. Installation & Initialization
1. Extract the application archive to a preferred local directory.
2. Execute `start.bat`. 
3. The system will automatically configure the required environment and launch the graphical interface in your default web browser (typically at http://localhost:8501).

## 4. Operation Workflow
### 4.1 Uploading Documents
Drag and drop your target PDF file into the upload zone, or click to browse your local file system. Supported format: `.pdf`.

### 4.2 Executing Extraction
Click the primary "开始解析" (Start Extraction) button. Depending on document complexity and page count, processing may require from several seconds up to a few minutes.

### 4.3 Reviewing & Exporting Results
Upon completion, the interface will display three distinct workspaces:
- **📄 Mixed Content (图文混合区):** Displays extracted text with inline images positioned contextually. You can highlight and copy this content directly to rich-text editors (e.g., Microsoft Word, Notion) retaining both text and images, or download it as a `.md` file.
- **📝 Pure Markdown (纯文本 Markdown 区):** Displays clean, text-only Markdown code. All image references are stripped. Ideal for LLM ingestion or plain-text archiving.
- **🖼️ Artwork Assets (美术素材区):** A gallery of all extracted visual assets and vector drawings. You may download individual images or use the bulk download button to acquire a consolidated `.zip` archive.

## 5. Troubleshooting & Edge Cases
- **Warning Banner Displayed:** If a yellow warning banner appears, it indicates the PDF was likely converted to outlines (Create Outlines) prior to export, or is a flattened scanned image. These documents lack underlying text streams and require external Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools for text extraction. However, the system's fallback mechanisms will still attempt to isolate and extract all visual elements into the Artwork Assets tab.
- **Application Fails to Launch:** Ensure the directory path does not contain special characters or spaces. Verify your system's execution policies permit running batch scripts.
